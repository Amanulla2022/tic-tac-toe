# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built with React. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with "X" and "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game is considered a tie.
